<h1>Happy Birthday, Cutie Pie!!!</h1>

        It all started on a crisp autumn morning. The kind where the air smells like firewood and possibilities. I remember tying my shoes on the porch, coffee in hand, heart racing for no real reason other than the thrill of not knowing what the day would bring. The leaves crunched under my boots like brittle paper, and every breath felt like a tiny restart — fresh and unhurried.
        I wandered past the bakery, drawn in not by the smell but by the sound of laughter spilling out the door. A little girl stood on tiptoes, pointing at a chocolate croissant behind the glass. Her dad smiled and nodded, and it made me think about the small joys we forget to notice. I kept walking, hands in pockets, eyes tracing the sky, which had turned a soft kind of blue — the shade that makes you pause even if you're in a rush.
        By the time I reached the end of the block, I had made up my mind. Today wasn’t about errands or to-do lists. It was about detours, and the spaces between destinations. I turned right instead of left, not knowing exactly where I was headed, and somehow that felt exactly right. Sometimes, the best days are the ones that don’t follow a plan at all.
